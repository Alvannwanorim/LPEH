                                    From the historical cultural perspective, women have always been perceived as the
                                    weaker gender and
                                    this has extended sadly over the years to the educational sectors especially the
                                    Science, Technology,
                                    Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related subjects. This is not particularly the
                                    fault of the females as
                                    this has been culturally ingrained over time giving them the impression that their
                                    basic function is
                                    housekeeping and raising children, any other thing being an extra activity.

                                        most female children are usually
                                        provided with games
                                        and items that do not stimulate technological insights, for example, barbie
                                        dolls as
                                        against the male

                                    Formal education was even
                                    considered wasteful since females would eventually be married off to become
                                    housewives. In our
                                    modern day and with technological advancement, most female children are usually
                                    provided with games
                                    and items that do not stimulate technological insights, for example, barbie dolls as
                                    against the male
                                    children with car racing games and brick building. The assumptions that the society
                                    makes about males
                                    and females, about some perceived differences in their abilities, behaviour, roles
                                    and aspiration is also a
                                    contributing factor. According to a World Bank report on the Nigerian University
                                    System, female
                                    academic staff stagnated at a level of about 14 percent. 40 percent earn doctorates
                                    in Life Sciences, 20
                                    percent in physical sciences and mathematics and 10percent in Engineering. The
                                    female folk have
                                    however gladly taken to secretarial, banking and administrative duties and have
                                    created a healthy niche
                                    there.
                                </p>

                                    For example, there has never been a female Minister of power in Nigeria but there
                                    has been a
                                    female Minister of Finance. There are only a handful number of female professors in
                                    STEM and a few
                                    females studying STEM related courses in Higher Institution despite the fact that
                                    women make up a
                                    higher percentage of the overall population. It is noteworthy to say that over time,
                                    women have
                                    accepted their position and role in the pyramid. Is it that they are not capable? Is
                                    it that their brains are
                                    not fully developed? I beg to answer No, because interestingly, the few females that
                                    have ventured into
                                    STEM related courses and careers have performed excellently well. Some other issues
                                    include sexual
                                    harassment, financial constraints and domestic related problems such as domestic
                                    responsibilities,
                                    marriage and business. It also widely acclaimed that STEM courses require full
                                    commitment and
                                    concentration, hence combining it with domestic duties makes studying a daunting
                                    task. Hence, the
                                    major issue is the general misconception that women are second place after men and
                                    that there are a
                                    certain area of knowledge meant for men alone.
                                </p>


                                <p>Ways in which this issue can be addressed include: To ensure that females are
                                    encouraged and given
                                    attractive incentives such as scholarships and award of bursaries to participate and
                                    study in STEM
                                    related courses in both secondary and higher institution levels. A deliberate
                                    admission quota for females
                                    in STEM related courses and assignment of the female students to female achievers in
                                    STEM careers
                                    who will serve as mentors. Funds should be made available to provide affordable
                                    loans for Small to
                                    Medium Enterprises (SMEs) run by female entrepreneurs doing business in the STEM
                                    sector. This is very
                                    necessary to boost their confidence. Success stories of female achievers in STEM
                                    should be published on
                                    social media and in the National dailies to encourage younger females. Networks for
                                    female engineers
                                    and energy enthusiasts should be encouraged to boost professionalism. Vocational
                                    training schools
                                    strictly for females and fully sponsored should be instituted to enhance skill
                                    acquisition and encourage
                                    females. Women should also be reoriented about what their role is towards ending
                                    poverty and to
                                    sustainable development in their communities. They should also be engaged in
                                    installation of energy
                                    systems and intensive training. Also, STEM based organizations should be enforced to
                                    employ a certain
                                    percentage of females, if possible, immediate employment, with incentives for the
                                    company such as tax
                                    rebates or penalties such as heavy fines or whatever needs to be done to ensure
                                    smooth compliance.
                                    Toys for females should be modified to increase their mental and spatial abilities.
                                    Last but not the least,
                                    the society at large has to be enlightened on the need for a change of attitude to
                                    gender roles.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The likely outcome is that this will encourage more females to engage in more STEM
                                    related studies and
                                    knowledge acquisition especially in the technical aspects of the energy sector which
                                    in turn will serve as
                                    a stepping stone for others. This would lead to more female entrepreneurs who will
                                    be able to set up
                                    small businesses and create employment for other women in engineering activities, in
                                    awareness
                                    creation, in sales and marketing of technological products, in solar PV systems for
                                    residential and mini
                                    grids for rural communities and other productive activities. This will help
                                    alleviate energy poverty to a
                                    large extent and help grow the economy. This will help provide electricity for basic
                                    amenities like
                                    lighting, clean water and to power small appliances for hair salons, restaurants,
                                    schools, markets and
                                    hospitals. This also means income for the females and better livelihood for their
                                    families. Lastly, the
                                    perception of the society will change and it will be accepted and normal for females
                                    to venture into the
                                    STEM related courses and careers.

                                    The recommended solution is to have programmes and vocational trainings tailored
                                    towards developing
                                    skill and technical expertise in energy related studies, careers and activities for
                                    women. More
                                    sponsorship or investment should be made towards women empowerment in the STEM
                                    sectors,
                                    affordable loans for the creation of small businesses and more employment for women
                                    in the STEM
                                    sector. Networks for female STEM members should be encouraged to boost
                                    professionalism.
                                </p>


                                <p>
                                    The justification is that women have always performed well in hands-on activities
                                    such as tailoring,
                                    knitting, cooking as well as other STEM related job functions like lab attendants,
                                    midwives where a
                                    certain level of mastery is usually vital. This implies women can equally perform
                                    well in the technical
                                    aspects of the energy sector including the innovation, design, manufacture and
                                    installation of energy
                                    systems and solutions if encouraged. In summary, it is safe to say that women have
                                    the capability and
                                    mental capacity to be effectively empowered to take on the numerous opportunities
                                    available in the
                                    energy sector.
